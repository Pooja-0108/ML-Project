# Image Compression with K-Means Clustering
*This project involved the use of k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to
build an image compression application with interactive controls.
*It included Data Pre-processing and Visualizing the Color Space using Point Clouds and the K-means Reduced Color Space.
*Created Interactive Controls with Jupyter Widgets and build K-means Image Compression with Interactive Controls.
â€“ Skills Developed : Machine Learning, Clustering, Ipython, K-Means Clustering, Scikit-Learn
